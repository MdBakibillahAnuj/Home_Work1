            <h2>I am currently a web developer for fiverr with the responsibilities of leading and performing projects from planning to execution.

                I understand HTML and CSS. HTML is the most used markup language across the web, and web developers use it to create web pages on the Internet. CSS, on the other hand, is used to style the website. It's responsible for the choice of fonts, colors and layout in a website's design. Whereas HTML lays the foundation for a webpage, CSS styles it.
                
                As a web developer, I have keen analytical skills to create a variety of successful websites. Also, I understand the needs of my clients. I analyze their wants and needs and be ready to adapt to any changes they'd like to see implemented on the website. I have some knowledge on JavaScript and jQuery that implements complex features onto a website. I also know about bootstrap and uikit.
                
                From my experience I know how to continuously test my webpage for any possible errors. If should any arise, I have the knowledge how to debug it.
                
                As I am a student of computer science and engineering subject, I also have the fundamental knowledge of back-end web development. I have some knowledge about database and SQL and cybersecurity.
                
                All of that don't worry about speed optimization. I will optimize your pages so that they can load faster on your browser. Visitors will not be bored or irritated while they will visit the site.</h2>
